# Futbol

It was a clear winter afternoon when Aedan, Sam, Ian, and Michael became bound together for a week and some days.
Their mission, simple. 
Conquer Futbol.

They embarked on their journey, hand in hand, together *forever*.

* Through sleepless nights, 
* battling the monsterous Miss. covid, 
* and preparing for the battle of the final boss... **Pofessor T**, that came after their journey...

The heros came out of their treacherous journey with their heads held high and winning smiles.

Their lessons learned?

* OOP
* TDD
* the true meaning of friendship
* and how to navigate and work through a CSV

The End. 
Byeeeeee!
